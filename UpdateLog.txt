----UPDATE LOG----

#Version 11:
removed option to select number of strips set it default to 1px size
version 10 took 390sec with stripsize of 1 px removed it's object dedection and created finder function
now version 11 takes 41sec to find all objects with stripsize of 1px
Added a medianfilter to limiter to help him out
renaming some classes to make more sense
finder function finished

#Version 10:
grayscaling full image befor cutting into strips
same with binarizing and logical map
improved processingspeed by 30%

#Version 9:
improved Limiter code, added recursivity of function
looked deeper into object selection and now it makes better result as well as "cleaner" code
cutter was not working corectly. made of function for cutter and fixed it
length calc corrected. but needs to be adapten if motor changes
displaying stl now, removed surf plot

#Version 8:
Image removal amelioration
fixing putting model to ground
ground angle correction fix, positiv and negativ angles
Changed code selecting object to store in matrix. Now bigger white area is used. code is cleaner but 3D result is less good
Limiter to remove spikes implemented

#Version 7:
conveyer speed calculator added
Calibration folder managment amelioration
some error managment
correction hight calculation
matlab removes image where nothing is to be seen
moving object to new "ground"
if ground was not not flat fixed that.
Images can be rotatet if camera was mounted wrong
Laser angle correction (laser not horizontal fixed)

#Version 6:
Changing way to work on array so less compression of is needed
Compression removed
Selection between Checker-board calibration or Infos from Camera Data-sheet
smoothing in x & y axes
module folder name where images are stored

#Version 5:
Restructurisation of Scripts
New better way to creat STL file
Removing option to creat border surf is without and STL is full faces
Artificial scale factor can be added on model
Matrixes converted from fps to mm and from px to mm
Augmented resolution of x and y dimensions
Compressing Patch

#Version 4:
Adding Calibration all needed infos for that are given as parameters to script
Smooth out surface of plot if necessary no spiky surface


#Version 3:
Strips can now be 1 Pixel large
Other Optimisation for Strips
Changed Reconstruction from cutting of border to get to IMG size to recognizing Object and triming till there
Option to add Border to Object or not

#Version 2:
Changed to monochrome IMG
Creating STL file

#Version 1.2:
Added timer to know how long calculation took
Padding added to IMG so strips are multiple of IMG no more need for reconstuction for last strip
Trimming of padding if there are to many null values

#Version 1:
Reconstruction if last strip didn't went till end
Give border and fill missing
Creat surf of 3 matrixs

Test:
Reading colored IMG
Recognizes shape of certain color in IMG
Gets position of shape
