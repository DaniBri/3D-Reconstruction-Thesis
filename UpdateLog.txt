----UPDATE LOG----

#Git V3:
GUI added
Include rotate from user and laser angle correction in rgb2binarize
Edited function descriptions
Other minor changes

#Git V2:
Smoothing in other axe doesn't work
Laser angle correction own function
Laser correction angle fixed, Object array wasn't sorted correctly
If scan colour reversed option. (removed)
Fixed median filter
Added second cutter immediately after creating matrix to remove rows with no relevance
Ground angle correction is recursive

#Git V1:
Reworked all scripts
Ground angle correction is correct now

#Version 11:
Removed option to select number of strips set it default to 1px size
Version 10 took 390sec with strip size of 1 px removed it's object detection and created finder function
now version 11 takes 41sec to find all objects with strip size of 1px
Added a medianfilter to limiter to help him out
Renaming some classes to make more sense
Finder function finished

#Version 10:
Grayscaling full image before cutting into strips
Same with binarizing and logical map
Improved processing speed by 30%

#Version 9:
Improved Limiter code, added resistivity of function
Looked deeper into object selection and now it makes better result as well as "cleaner" code
Cutter was not working correctly. made of function for cutter and fixed it
Length calculation fixed, but needs to be adapted if motor changes
Displaying stl now, removed surf plot

#Version 8:
Image removal amelioration
Fixing putting model to ground
Ground angle correction fix, positive and negative angles
Changed code selecting object to store in matrix. Now bigger white area is used. code is cleaner but 3D result is less good
Limiter to remove spikes implemented

#Version 7:
Conveyor speed calculator added
Calibration folder management amelioration
Some error management
Correction hight calculation
Matlab removes image where nothing is to be seen
Moving object to new "ground"
If ground was not not flat fixed that.
Images can be rotated if camera was mounted wrong
Laser angle correction (laser not horizontal fixed)

#Version 6:
Changing way to work on array so less compression of is needed
Compression removed
Selection between Checker-board calibration or Infos from Camera Data-sheet
Smoothing in x & y axes
Module folder name where images are stored

#Version 5:
Scripts structure reworked
New better way to create STL file
Removing option to create border surf is without and STL is full faces
Artificial scale factor can be added on model
Matrices dimensions converted from fps to mm and from px to mm accordingly
Augmented resolution of x and y dimensions
Compressing Patch

#Version 4:
Adding Calibration all needed infos for that are given as parameters to script
Smooth out surface of plot if necessary no spiky surface

#Version 3:
Strips can now be 1 Pixel large
Other Optimisation for Strips
Changed Reconstruction from cutting of border to get to IMG size to recognizing Object and trimming till there
Option to add Border to Object or not

#Version 2:
Changed to monochrome IMG
Creating STL file

#Version 1.2:
Added timer to know how long calculation took
Padding added to IMG so strips are multiple of IMG no more need for reconstruction for last strip
Trimming of padding if there are to many null values

#Version 1:
Reconstruction if last strip didn't went till end
Give border and fill missing
Create surf of 3 matrices

Test:
Reading coloured IMG
Recognizes shape of certain colour in IMG
Gets position of shape
